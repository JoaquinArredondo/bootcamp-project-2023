                        <strong>DATE:</strong><emc>September 26th | 4:18 PM |</emc> Today was pretty good, 
                        I went to class from 1-2 but somehow I am still sleepy. Linear Analysis was kinda boring today I almost slept.

                        Today after class I bought 2 big bottles of vitamin water, sat down and started the Hack4Impact starter pack. 
                        After I did 50% of it, I went to do homework with Edgar and Sameer in the Gypsum Library. I ended by day wih waiting for my 
                        roomate <strong>Adrian</strong> to cook for the house. I still need to figure out what i'm going to make everyone.
